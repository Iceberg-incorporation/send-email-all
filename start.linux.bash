#!/bin/bash

# A simple test script to demonstrate how to find the
# "absolute path" at which a script is running. Used
# to avoid some of the pitfals of using 'pwd' or hard-
# coded paths when running scripts from cron or another
# directory.
#
# Try it out:
# run the script from the current directory, then 
# cd.. and run it again (using the file path).
#
# You can see that CURDIR changes depending on where
# you run the script from, but ABSDIR stays the same.

CURDIR=`/bin/pwd`
BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)
ABSPATH=$(readlink -f $0)
ABSDIR=$(dirname $ABSPATH)

# echo "CURDIR is $CURDIR"
# echo "BASEDIR is $BASEDIR"
# echo "ABSPATH is $ABSPATH"
# echo "ABSDIR is $ABSDIR"

cd "$BASEDIR"
